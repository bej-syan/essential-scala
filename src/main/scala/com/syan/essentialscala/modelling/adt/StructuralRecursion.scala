  * Structural recursion is the precise opposite of the process of building an algebraic data type.
  * The sum and product type patterns tell us how to combine data to make bigger data.
  *
  * Just as we have two patterns for building algebraic data types, we will have two patterns for
  * decomposing them using structural recursion.
  *   polymorphism
  *   pattern matching
